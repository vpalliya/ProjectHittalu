# ProjectHittalu - An Ontology of Edible Weeds

This is a project that identifies, catalgoues and creates an Ontology representation of all the edible weeds in the Deccan Plateau. 

The project captures information such as the native names (Kannada/Tamil/Telugu/Malayalam), the scientific name (Genus & Species), plant characteristics, nutritive and medicinal value, and other intersting trivia, apart from pointing to further information resources.

The project is conceived and driven by Anu Kothari @ Cisco/India.
